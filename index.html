									<h3><u>Message from Waves</u></h3>
									<h4>Hello everyone, I hope that during these difficult times you are staying safe and well.</h4>
									<h4>In light of the government and Swim England releasing guidelines on how swimming pools can start to reopen, we are working hard behind-the-scenes to ensure that we are well-prepared to meet the guidelines once a restart date has been agreed.</h4>
									<h4>The health and safety of our swimmers, their families and our poolside teachers is our number-one priority. We are working alongside the school and using Swim England's advice to be in the position to continue to deliver high-quality lessons, whilst adhering to enhanced hygiene and cleaning routines. We will maintain strict social distancing throughout all areas of our operation.</h4>
									<h4>Waves have been in close discussions with the school over the last few months regarding a start-back date, and have recently been advised that the earliest date for any third party hirer will be October of this year.</h4>
									<h4>We will keep you fully informed throughout this process once everything is in place. In the meantime, stay safe and well, and enjoy the summer.</h4>
									<h4>Caroline and the Waves team</h4>

											<h1>Waves Swim School</h1>
											<h2>Quality swimming lessons in Bristol</h2>
										<p><strong>Waves Swim School</strong> (founded 1998) provides swimming lessons to hundreds of children across Bristol, and has developed an excellent reputation for its high standard of teaching.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Waves Swim School</strong> have an experienced team of teachers, all holding ASA and RLSS qualifications, with full child protection and DBS coverage. We have a range of specialisms, to be able to teach swimmers and non-swimmers of all ages and abilities.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Waves Swim School</strong> strongly believes that children benefit from learning to swim in a fun, safe and structured way. Our ‘Beginner’ and ‘Learn-To-Swim’ lessons are small (taking a maximum of 4 children), with each child receiving the attention they need to develop core skills at their own pace, assisted by teachers in the water. Following the ‘Beginner’ and ‘Learn-To-Swim’ classes, they will learn more technical stroke work in all four strokes, and develop stamina and good form.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Waves Swim School</strong> can offer one-to-one lessons for adults and children on request. Swimmers are continually assessed, and progress at a rate suited to their ability.</p>
                                        <p>For full details of all the classes available, please see the <strong><a href="http://wavesswimschool.co.uk/timetables.html">Timetables</a></strong> page.</p>
