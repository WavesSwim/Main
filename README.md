#Hi Mum!

Test website for Waves Swim School. This is just a first draft, and the existence of these pages doesn't affect your current ([JustHost](http://wavesswimschool.co.uk/)) site in any way. Have a look through, and see if there are any sections missing, or any features you'd like changed. First glance everything seems to be in order :) Hosting sites on GitHub is completely free.

- Take a look at [Elements](https://wavesswim.co.uk/X-elements) - if you scroll down you can see there is room for images and blog posts to be added to the site, plus a range of other features. Don't worry too much about this for now (this page is not visible to the public). 

Finally, the current webpage link is [wavesswim.co.uk](https://wavesswim.co.uk/index) but we can most likely alter this to make it more memorable.
